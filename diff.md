# quick switch to previous and next diff
## open changes with previous revision
## open changes with next revision

# compared with visual studio diff
## pros
- more space for displaying diff
as vscode is more lightweight, it can display diff with more space
- icons for displaying diff throughout commit history(as stated above)
- zen mode diff
## cons
- unlike in visual studio, vscode shows added lines with yellow rather 
than green. this is less natural. however, this is a minor con.
- vscode use darker red and darder yellow to display chunk diff(inline diff).
this is less obvious than in visual studio, which uses solid boxes.
