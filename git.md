# icons
for files versioned with git, there are some fairly useful icon.
## git history
this icon is the leftmost one
## open changes with previous/next revision
this is described in detail in [diff.md](diff.md).
## open working file
this icon shows up after opening diff. used to return to the working file
## previous/next change
## git blame
## git graph
**git graph** is integrated into the **side bar**

# commit
when using `ctrl+enter` to commit **unstaged files**, **a warning dialog pops up**. this is reasonable. 

# sync
- click `...` in the **side bar** of source control to
trigger `sync`. 
- `sync` is a combination of `pull` and `push`.

# actions
- push(follow tags) note: need to choose a repository

# several git repositories
when invoking `open folder`, only one git repository is shown. however, when invoking
`add folder to workspace`(after `open workspace`), it is possible to manipulate several
repositories.
